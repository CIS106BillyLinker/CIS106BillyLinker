I am William Linker, I go by Billy. I am taking this class because I am looking to go into cybersecurity as a career, and I know that I will need programming skills in order to succeed. I took one coding class in Highschool and enjoyed it so I also am taking this class just to expand on my knowledge. I think coding is an important skill to atleast have some knowledge about since everything on the internet functions from it. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge on coding and hopefully using it to work on side projects or maybe make a game of my own at some point.
